# AirSurf-Wheat

This is the repository for the AirSurf-Wheat project that aims to take UAV images of wheat breeding fields and segment out the individual plots for extraction of phenotypic traits.

The pipeline works as is, although it currently requires some hand-tweaking of a few parameters and the web interface is not completed. This project began life as a Jupyter Notebook, so apologies that the code has not been better organized.

Check out AirSurf/pipeline/pipeline.py and the IPython/ directory for two different instances of the analysis pipeline. They should do the same thing.

## Funding

This project was funded by the [Designing Future Wheat](https://designingfuturewheat.org.uk).
